# Jungle Gym

Jungle Gym is a climbing virtual reality game in which the player must race to the finish line in order to achieve the highscore!

Jungle Gym was created as a group project for our college module "Gesture Based URI Development". The main focus of this project was to incorporate gestures into a project and we opted for creating a VR climbing game. This game incorporates gestures such as grabbing, pointing, pushing and voice usage.
